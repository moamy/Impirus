# Loading screen
Would definitely like a loading screen! Maybe the whole screen goes frosted glass with the logo spinning? Do you think we could make it non-linear? Im not sure what the term for it would be in coding but in animation I use these curves (ill attach below) basically its exponential - my thought process is that if its taking a while to load, its more satisfying to watch and also makes the user think they're getting somewhere. Like each time the logo is at 0 degrees, it starts slow and then speeds up until it has gone 180. Does that make sense? I wouldnt mind recording a video in 3d to demonstrate! Also if its too tricky dont worry about it haha, really not a priority atm!

# Modal
Sounds like a great idea ngl. What do you think if we make it really simplistic like windows xp looking? I can write some text about what it is etc. And have a line at the end of the text like the user is typing? Ill put an example image.

for this, what if instead of white its frosted glass and the user can click the x to close it? either that or it pops up when the user hovers over, what do you think? Also do you think it might be frosted glass overload or not yet?

# Carousel framework
Ah i see, no stress! Would we use framework also for a carousel for the animations? Would that be too hard to do? Alternatively I could edit a compilation of all the animations so we could just have it as one video, this could also be a solution if it is taking way too long to load the pages because of the amount of videos being displayed - not sure how much of an issue that would be.

Would love to see this! We could test it out
